# My-Stock Development Plan (Minimal Approach)

## Project Overview

My-Stock is a streamlined stock analysis and portfolio management platform. Starting with core functionality and expanding gradually based on user needs.

## Core Tech Stack (Essentials Only)

### Required Technologies
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 (App Router)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **UI**: Shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS
- **Authentication**: Clerk (already configured)
- **Package Manager**: pnpm

### To Be Added When Needed
- Database (start with local JSON/localStorage)
- Stock Data API (start with mock data)
- Real-time updates (add in later phases)
- Advanced charting (start with basic charts)

## Minimal Project Structure

```

## Development Phases (Minimal MVP)

### Phase 1: Foundation & Mock Data (Week 1)
**Goal**: Get a working prototype with mock data

- [x] Basic project setup (already done)
- [ ] Create TypeScript types for stocks and portfolios
- [ ] Set up mock data structure
- [ ] Create basic layout with navigation
- [ ] Dashboard overview page with static content
- [ ] Basic routing between pages

**Deliverables**:
```typescript
// Basic types
interface Stock {
  symbol: string;
  name: string;
  price: number;
  change: number;
  changePercent: number;
}

interface Portfolio {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  stocks: PortfolioStock[];
  totalValue: number;
}
```

### Phase 2: Stock Search & Display (Week 2)
**Goal**: Browse and view stock information

- [ ] Stock search page with mock data
- [ ] Search functionality (filter mock data)
- [ ] Stock detail page
- [ ] Basic price display component
- [ ] Simple line chart for price history
- [ ] Add to watchlist button (local storage)

**Key Components**:
- StockSearch component
- StockCard component
- PriceDisplay component
- SimpleChart component (using Recharts)

### Phase 3: Portfolio Management (Week 3)
**Goal**: Create and manage a portfolio

- [ ] Portfolio creation (stored in localStorage)
- [ ] Add stocks to portfolio
- [ ] Remove stocks from portfolio
- [ ] Portfolio value calculation
- [ ] Basic holdings table
- [ ] Simple pie chart for allocation

**Key Features**:
- Create one portfolio
- Add/remove stocks
- Track quantity and purchase price
- Calculate total value and gains/losses

### Phase 4: Real Stock Data Integration (Week 4)
**Goal**: Replace mock data with real data

- [ ] Choose a free stock API (Alpha Vantage free tier)
- [ ] Create API service layer
- [ ] Replace mock data with API calls
- [ ] Add loading states
- [ ] Handle API errors
- [ ] Implement basic caching

**API Integration**:
```typescript
// Start with just these endpoints
GET /api/stocks/search?q={query}
GET /api/stocks/{symbol}/quote
GET /api/stocks/{symbol}/history
```

### Phase 5: Data Persistence (Week 5)
**Goal**: Save user data properly

- [ ] Choose database solution (Supabase or PostgreSQL)
- [ ] Set up database schema
- [ ] Migrate localStorage data to database
- [ ] Connect portfolio to user accounts
- [ ] Add data validation
- [ ] Implement error handling

**Database Tables**:
- users (handled by Clerk)
- portfolios
- portfolio_stocks
- watchlist

### Phase 6: Polish & Optimization (Week 6)
**Goal**: Improve user experience

- [ ] Add loading skeletons
- [ ] Improve mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Add basic animations
- [ ] Implement error boundaries
- [ ] Add success/error toasts
- [ ] Basic performance optimization

## Step-by-Step Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Start with Static Data
```typescript
// lib/mock-data/stocks.ts
export const mockStocks = [
  { symbol: 'AAPL', name: 'Apple Inc.', price: 150.00, change: 2.50 },
  { symbol: 'GOOGL', name: 'Alphabet Inc.', price: 2800.00, change: -15.00 },
  // ... more mock data
];
```

### Step 2: Build UI Components First
- Use Shadcn components as base
- Create composite components for stocks
- Focus on layout and design
- No complex state management yet

### Step 3: Add Interactivity
- Search filtering
- Sorting tables
- Adding to lists
- Simple calculations

### Step 4: Integrate Real Data
- One API at a time
- Start with read-only operations
- Add caching to reduce API calls
- Handle rate limits

### Step 5: Add Persistence
- Start with localStorage
- Move to database when ready
- Keep it simple (no complex queries)

## What We're NOT Building (Yet)

### Features to Skip Initially
- ❌ Real-time price updates
- ❌ Advanced technical indicators
- ❌ Multiple portfolios
- ❌ Transaction history
- ❌ News integration
- ❌ Price alerts
- ❌ Export functionality
- ❌ Social features
- ❌ Mobile app
- ❌ Advanced analytics

### Libraries to Avoid Initially
- ❌ Complex state management (Redux/Zustand)
- ❌ WebSockets
- ❌ Advanced charting libraries
- ❌ PDF generation
- ❌ Email notifications
- ❌ Payment processing

## Development Principles

### Keep It Simple
1. **Start with mock data** - Don't integrate APIs until UI is ready
2. **One feature at a time** - Complete each feature before moving on
3. **Avoid premature optimization** - Make it work, then make it fast
4. **Use what you know** - Stick to familiar patterns initially

### Progressive Enhancement
```
Mock Data → API Integration → Database → Optimization → Advanced Features
```

### Code Quality Standards
- TypeScript for type safety
- Simple, readable code over clever solutions
- Components under 150 lines
- Clear naming conventions
- Basic error handling

## Essential Environment Variables

```env
# Phase 1-3: Minimal Setup
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=

# Phase 4: API Integration
STOCK_API_KEY=
STOCK_API_PROVIDER=alphavantage

# Phase 5: Database
DATABASE_URL=
```

## Simple Development Workflow

```bash
# Daily Development
pnpm dev          # Start development server
pnpm build        # Check production build
pnpm lint         # Check for issues

# When Adding Features
1. Create mock data first
2. Build the UI
3. Add interactivity
4. Integrate real data
5. Test and refine
```

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Over-engineering early** - Don't add Redux if useState works
2. **Too many dependencies** - Each library adds complexity
3. **Perfect is the enemy of done** - Ship MVP, iterate later
4. **Ignoring mobile** - Test on phone regularly
5. **Complex calculations early** - Start with simple math

## Definition of Done (MVP)

A feature is complete when:
- [ ] It works with mock data
- [ ] Basic UI is responsive
- [ ] TypeScript types are defined
- [ ] Basic error handling exists
- [ ] It's tested manually
- [ ] Code is committed

## Next Steps After MVP

Once the MVP is stable and users are happy:

1. **Gather feedback** - What do users actually want?
2. **Add one feature at a time** - Based on user needs
3. **Improve performance** - Only optimize what's slow
4. **Add advanced features** - When basics are solid
5. **Consider mobile app** - If users request it

---

**Remember**: The goal is to build a working product that users can try, not a perfect product that never ships. Start simple, ship early, iterate based on feedback.
