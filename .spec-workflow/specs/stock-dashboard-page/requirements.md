## Non-Functional Requirements

### Code Architecture and Modularity
- **Single Responsibility**: Separate chart component, ticker input, and data fetching logic
- **Modular Design**: TradingView wrapper as reusable component across features
- **Dependency Management**: Lazy load TradingView library only on dashboard page
- **Clear Interfaces**: TypeScript interfaces for stock data, chart config, and API responses

### Performance
- Initial chart render < 1 second after page load
- Ticker switch latency < 2 seconds including data fetch
- Chart interactions (zoom/pan) < 16ms for 60fps smoothness
- Memory usage < 100MB for chart with 1 year of daily data
- Bundle size increase < 200KB gzipped for TradingView library

### Security
- Validate all ticker inputs server-side before API calls
- Sanitize ticker symbols to prevent injection attacks
- Rate limit ticker requests to 60 per minute per user
- Use environment variables for API keys, never expose client-side
- Implement CORS policies for external data sources

### Reliability
- Graceful degradation if TradingView CDN unavailable
- Retry logic with exponential backoff for failed API calls
- Local storage backup of last 5 viewed tickers
- Error boundaries to prevent chart crashes affecting entire page
- 99.9% uptime for chart rendering during market hours

### Usability
- Responsive design: Full functionality on screens â‰¥768px width
- Mobile: Touch-optimized chart controls for tablet devices
- Keyboard shortcuts: "/" to focus ticker input, Enter to submit
- Loading states: Skeleton screens while data fetches
- Error messages: Clear, actionable guidance for users
