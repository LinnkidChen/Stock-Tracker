# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements live stock price fetching for the WatchlistCard component, replacing static mock data with real-time stock quotes. The component currently displays a list of watchlist symbols but lacks price information and real-time updates. This enhancement will transform it into a dynamic monitoring tool that displays current prices, daily changes, and percentage movements for all watchlist items.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This feature directly supports Stock Tracker's core mission of providing real-time market insights and portfolio performance tracking. As outlined in the product vision:
- **Real-time Performance**: Delivers live price updates with minimal latency for watchlist monitoring
- **Data Accuracy First**: Ensures accurate, verifiable stock prices from reliable API sources
- **Intuitive Visualization**: Presents price changes with clear visual indicators (green/red for up/down)
- **Key Features Support**: Enhances the "Watchlist & Alerts" feature with actual market data

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Live Price Display

**User Story:** As an individual investor, I want to see current stock prices for my watchlist items, so that I can monitor market movements without navigating to individual stock pages

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the WatchlistCard component loads THEN the system SHALL fetch current stock quotes for all watchlist symbols
2. IF a stock quote is successfully fetched THEN the system SHALL display the current price, daily change amount, and percentage change
3. WHEN a new symbol is added to the watchlist THEN the system SHALL immediately fetch and display its current price data
4. IF a stock quote fetch fails THEN the system SHALL display the symbol with a loading or error indicator without breaking the entire watchlist

### Requirement 2: Optimized Data Fetching

**User Story:** As a user with multiple watchlist items, I want efficient data loading, so that the interface remains responsive even with many symbols

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple symbols exist in the watchlist THEN the system SHALL batch fetch requests or use parallel fetching to minimize load time
2. IF the same symbol data is requested within 5 minutes THEN the system SHALL serve cached data to respect API rate limits
3. WHEN the component unmounts THEN the system SHALL cancel any pending fetch requests to prevent memory leaks
4. IF the API rate limit is approached THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate throttling or queuing mechanisms

### Requirement 3: Visual Price Indicators

**User Story:** As a day trader, I want clear visual indicators of price movements, so that I can quickly identify which stocks are gaining or losing value

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a stock price increases from the previous close THEN the system SHALL display the price change in green with an up arrow indicator
2. WHEN a stock price decreases from the previous close THEN the system SHALL display the price change in red with a down arrow indicator
3. IF the price change is zero THEN the system SHALL display the price in neutral color with no directional indicator
4. WHEN hovering over a stock item THEN the system SHALL highlight it for better readability

### Requirement 4: Error Handling and Fallbacks

**User Story:** As a user, I want the watchlist to remain functional even when some data fails to load, so that partial outages don't prevent me from using the feature

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. IF a stock quote fetch fails after retries THEN the system SHALL display "Price unavailable" or similar message for that specific symbol
2. WHEN network connectivity is lost THEN the system SHALL show the last known prices with a stale data indicator
3. IF the stock API service is completely unavailable THEN the system SHALL display an informative error message with retry option
4. WHEN an invalid symbol exists in the watchlist THEN the system SHALL mark it as invalid without affecting other symbols

### Requirement 5: Loading States

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see loading indicators while data is being fetched, so that I know the system is working

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the component initially loads THEN the system SHALL display skeleton loaders or spinners for each watchlist item
2. IF individual stock data is being refreshed THEN the system SHALL show a subtle loading indicator without hiding existing data
3. WHEN all data has loaded THEN the system SHALL remove all loading indicators and display the complete information
4. IF loading takes longer than 3 seconds THEN the system SHALL display a message indicating that loading is taking longer than usual

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Code Architecture and Modularity
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Separate data fetching logic from UI rendering in the WatchlistCard component
- **Modular Design**: Create reusable hooks for stock quote fetching that can be used by other components
- **Dependency Management**: Utilize existing useStockQuote hook and stock service infrastructure
- **Clear Interfaces**: Define TypeScript interfaces for watchlist items with price data

### Performance
- Initial data load must complete within 3 seconds for up to 20 watchlist items
- Subsequent updates should reflect within 500ms of user action
- Component should remain responsive during data fetching operations
- Memory usage should not exceed 50MB even with 50+ watchlist items

### Security
- All API calls must use secure HTTPS connections
- API keys must never be exposed in client-side code
- Input validation must occur for all user-provided symbols
- Rate limiting must be enforced to prevent API abuse

### Reliability
- Component must gracefully handle API failures without crashing
- Cached data should persist across component remounts
- Retry logic must implement exponential backoff
- System must handle malformed API responses

### Usability
- Price changes must be immediately recognizable through color coding
- Loading states must be non-intrusive for returning users
- Error messages must be actionable and user-friendly
- Component must be keyboard accessible for navigation
