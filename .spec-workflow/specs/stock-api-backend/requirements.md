# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a backend API service that fetches real-time stock market data from Alpha Vantage and provides it to the frontend application. The API will handle data fetching, transformation, and delivery through RESTful endpoints, enabling the Stock Tracker dashboard to display live market information without direct external API calls from the client.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This backend API directly supports the Stock Tracker's core objectives by:
- Providing **real-time stock price tracking** essential for portfolio valuation and market monitoring
- Enabling **data accuracy** through server-side validation and error handling
- Supporting **platform reliability** by centralizing external API management and rate limiting
- Facilitating **real-time performance** through efficient data caching and transformation
- Protecting user privacy by keeping API keys secure on the server

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Stock Price Data Fetching

**User Story:** As an investor, I want to see real-time stock prices, so that I can monitor my portfolio's current value

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests stock data for a valid symbol THEN the system SHALL return current price, change, and percentage change
2. IF the stock symbol is invalid THEN the system SHALL return a clear error message with status code 400
3. WHEN multiple users request the same stock within 60 seconds THEN the system SHALL serve cached data to optimize API usage
4. WHEN Alpha Vantage API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL return status code 503 with appropriate error message

### Requirement 2: Quote Endpoint

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want a simple endpoint to fetch stock quotes, so that I can display them in the dashboard

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a GET request is made to /api/stocks/quote/{symbol} THEN the system SHALL return stock quote data in JSON format
2. IF the request includes multiple symbols (comma-separated) THEN the system SHALL return an array of quote objects
3. WHEN the response is successful THEN the system SHALL include symbol, price, change, changePercent, volume, and timestamp fields
4. IF Alpha Vantage rate limit is exceeded THEN the system SHALL return status code 429 with retry-after header

### Requirement 3: API Key Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want API keys stored securely, so that they cannot be exposed to clients

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server starts THEN the system SHALL load Alpha Vantage API key from environment variables
2. IF the API key is missing or invalid THEN the system SHALL log an error and refuse to start
3. WHEN any request is made THEN the system SHALL never expose the API key in responses or logs
4. IF the API key becomes invalid THEN the system SHALL alert administrators through error logs

### Requirement 4: Error Handling

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want consistent error responses, so that I can handle them appropriately in the UI

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any error occurs THEN the system SHALL return a standardized error response with status, message, and error code
2. IF the error is client-related (4xx) THEN the system SHALL include helpful guidance for resolution
3. WHEN server errors occur (5xx) THEN the system SHALL log full details internally while returning safe messages to clients
4. IF network timeouts occur THEN the system SHALL retry once before returning error

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Code Architecture and Modularity
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Separate concerns into service (Alpha Vantage integration), controller (request handling), and transformer (data formatting) layers
- **Modular Design**: Create reusable utilities for API calls, caching, and error handling
- **Dependency Management**: Use dependency injection for the Alpha Vantage service to enable testing
- **Clear Interfaces**: Define TypeScript interfaces for all API responses and data structures

### Performance
- Response time SHALL be under 500ms for cached data
- Response time SHALL be under 2 seconds for fresh API calls
- System SHALL handle at least 100 concurrent requests
- Cache hit ratio SHALL exceed 70% during market hours

### Security
- All API keys SHALL be stored in environment variables
- All responses SHALL include appropriate CORS headers
- Input validation SHALL prevent injection attacks
- Rate limiting SHALL prevent API abuse

### Reliability
- System SHALL maintain 99.9% uptime during market hours
- System SHALL gracefully degrade when Alpha Vantage is unavailable
- System SHALL implement circuit breaker pattern for external API calls
- All errors SHALL be logged for monitoring and debugging

### Usability
- API documentation SHALL be clear and include example requests/responses
- Error messages SHALL be actionable and user-friendly
- Response format SHALL be consistent across all endpoints
- API SHALL follow RESTful conventions for predictability
