- **Feature Modules**: Self-contained features with their own components, actions, and utilities

### Data Storage (if applicable)
- **Primary storage**: Database-agnostic design (ready for PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MongoDB integration)
- **Caching**: Next.js built-in caching with ISR support
- **State Management**: Zustand for client state, URL state with Nuqs for persistence
- **Data formats**: JSON for API communication, TypeScript interfaces for type safety

### External Integrations (if applicable)
- **APIs**: RESTful API design with Next.js API routes
- **Protocols**: HTTP/HTTPS with support for WebSocket integration
- **Authentication**: Clerk for complete auth solution with JWT tokens
- **Error Tracking**: Sentry for production monitoring and debugging
- **Real-time**: Ready for WebSocket or Server-Sent Events integration

### Monitoring & Dashboard Technologies (if applicable)
- **Dashboard Framework**: React 19 with Next.js 15 App Router
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket-ready architecture
- **Visualization Libraries**: Recharts for charts, custom components for metrics cards
- **State Management**: Zustand for global state, React Hook Form for form state
- **UI Components**: Shadcn-ui built on Radix UI for accessibility

- **Code Review Process**: Pull request reviews with automated checks
- **Commit Standards**: Conventional commits with automated formatting

### Dashboard Development (if applicable)
- **Live Reload**: Turbopack for instant hot module replacement
- **Port Management**: Configurable port with default 3000
- **Multi-Instance Support**: Environment-based configuration
- **Development Tools**: React Developer Tools, Redux DevTools compatible

## Deployment & Distribution (if applicable)
- **Target Platform(s)**: Vercel (optimized), AWS, Google Cloud, or any Node.js hosting
- **Distribution Method**: Git-based deployment with CI/CD pipelines
- **Installation Requirements**: Node.js 20+, pnpm package manager
- **Update Mechanism**: Git-based updates with automated deployment

## Technical Requirements & Constraints

### Performance Requirements
- **Initial Load Time**: < 3 seconds on 3G networks
- **Time to Interactive**: < 5 seconds
- **Lighthouse Score**: > 90 for performance metrics
- **Bundle Size**: Optimized with code splitting and tree shaking
- **Memory Usage**: Efficient with React 19 automatic batching

### Compatibility Requirements  
- **Platform Support**: All modern browsers (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+)
- **Mobile Support**: Responsive design for all screen sizes
- **Dependency Versions**: Node.js 20+, React 19, Next.js 15
- **Standards Compliance**: WCAG 2.1 Level AA accessibility

### Security & Compliance
- **Security Requirements**: 
  - Secure authentication with Clerk (OAuth 2.0, JWT)
  - HTTPS enforced in production
  - Content Security Policy headers
  - XSS and CSRF protection
- **Compliance Standards**: GDPR-ready with privacy-first design
- **Threat Model**: Protection against OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities

### Scalability & Reliability
- **Expected Load**: 10,000+ concurrent users
- **Availability Requirements**: 99.9% uptime target
- **Growth Projections**: Horizontal scaling with edge functions
- **Performance Optimization**: Static generation, ISR, and edge caching

## Technical Decisions & Rationale

### Decision Log
1. **Next.js 15 with App Router**: Chosen for superior performance, SEO benefits, and developer experience. Server components reduce client bundle size significantly.

2. **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Enforces type safety throughout the codebase, reducing runtime errors and improving maintainability.

3. **Clerk for Authentication**: Complete auth solution that handles security complexities, allowing focus on business logic rather than auth implementation.

4. **Shadcn-ui over Material-UI**: Provides full control over components with excellent accessibility defaults while maintaining smaller bundle size.

5. **Zustand over Redux**: Simpler state management with less boilerplate while maintaining TypeScript support and devtools integration.

6. **Tailwind CSS v4**: Utility-first approach speeds development while new v4 features provide better performance and developer experience.

7. **Feature-based Organization**: Improves code discoverability and maintains clear boundaries between different parts of the application.

8. **Sentry Integration**: Proactive error monitoring essential for production applications to maintain quality and quick issue resolution.

## Known Limitations

- **SSR Complexity**: Server components require careful consideration of client/server boundaries
- **Build Times**: Large applications may experience longer build times (mitigated by Turbopack in development)
- **Learning Curve**: App Router patterns differ from Pages Router, requiring team adaptation
- **Third-party Integration**: Some libraries may not yet fully support React 19/Next.js 15 (using legacy peer deps as workaround)
